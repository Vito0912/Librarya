# Librarya

Librarya is a web-oriented media organization website that idea is based on calibre-web - but itÂ´s more.

# Important

This is a private project designed to simplify media reading and syncing across multiple devices for my personal use. I only share it if someone wants to use it. It is my first project using Next.js and Typescript, and there is ample room for improvement. If you would like to contribute or use this project as a starting point for your own project, feel free to fork it. Additionally, if you find this idea interesting, you can help me improve my code :).
